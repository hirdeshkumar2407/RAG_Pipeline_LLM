While most plants perform photosynthesis as part of their biological processes, some plants have lost the ability to produce chlorophyll or to perform photosynthesis altogether. For example, some parasitic and mycotrophic plants may lose the ability to produce chlorophyll or to photosynthesize. Additionally, some plants may experience a reduction in photosynthetic activity under certain environmental conditions, such as shading or low light levels. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that all plants do photosynthesis. However, the vast majority of plants do engage in photosynthesis to varying degrees. \n\nIn conclusion, while most plants do perform photosynthesis, not all plants do so. The ability to perform photosynthesis is not universal among all plant species. Some plants may have lost the capacity to perform photosynthesis due to their lifestyle or environmental factors. \n\nNote: The answer above was corrected based on the additional information provided in\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":23},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Model Inspection","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from transformers import AutoConfig, AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\n\nmodel_name = \"AITeamVN/Vi-Qwen2-3B-RAG\" # Ensure this is the correct model name\n\nprint(f\"\\n---  Inspecting Configuration for {model_name} ---\")\n\ntry:\n    # Load the configuration\n    config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(model_name)\n    print(\"\\nModel Configuration Loaded Successfully.\")\n\n    # a) Maximum Context Window / Sequence Length\n    # Common attribute names for max sequence length / context window:\n    # 'max_position_embeddings', 'n_positions', 'n_ctx'\n    # The exact name can vary between model architectures.\n    max_len_attrs = ['max_position_embeddings', 'n_positions', 'n_ctx', 'sliding_window'] # Qwen2 uses 'sliding_window' or implies by rope_theta\n    context_window = None\n    print(\"\\nPotential attributes for max context window:\")\n    for attr in max_len_attrs:\n        if hasattr(config, attr):\n            value = getattr(config, attr)\n            print(f\"  - Found '{attr}': {value}\")\n            if isinstance(value, int) and (context_window is None or value > context_window) and attr != 'sliding_window': # sliding_window is different\n                context_window = value\n            if attr == 'sliding_window' and value is not None:\n                print(f\"    Note: This model uses a sliding window of {value}.

For example, using the SSH protocol to implement a VPN is possible, but presently only with the OpenSSH server and clien...\n\n  --- Generating LLM Answer (Baseline) ---\n  Generated Answer:\n    OpenSSH is considered secure due to several key reasons:\n\n1. **End-to-End Encryption**: OpenSSH encrypts all information, including usernames and passwords, ensuring that data transmitted between the client and server is protected from unauthorized access.\n\n2. **Multi-Layer Security**: The protocol includes multiple layers of security, including authentication, data integrity, and encryption. This multi-layered approach helps ensure that various aspects of the communication are secure.\n\n3. **Authentication and Key Management**: OpenSSH uses public key authentication, which means that the private key is never transmitted over the network. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and ensures that only the correct user can authenticate.\n\n4. **Protocol Versioning**: OpenSSH supports multiple versions (SSH-1 and SSH-2) with different security features. SSH-2, which is the current standard, includes numerous improvements in security, such as stronger encryption algorithms and enhanced authentication mechanisms.\n\n5. **Forward Secrecy**: OpenSSH supports forward secrecy, meaning that even if long-term secret keys or passwords are compromised, encrypted communications and sessions recorded in the past cannot be retrieved and decrypted. This is achieved through the use of ephemeral keys, which are generated for each session.\n\n6. **Multiplexing\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n\n=== PROCESSING QUERY 2/6: \"What are the main components of Docker's service?\" ===\n  Retrieving context...\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"603835cd7ce2480dbb50d1090f626a3b"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"2c22347d80714643a9c6007fd9c37721"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stdout","text":"\n  --- Retrieved Context (first 500 chars) ---\nDocument 1:\n[\"VMware vSphere Integrated Containers.

This ensures that even if the data is intercepted, it remains unreadable without the proper decryption key. Additionally, OpenSSH supports various cryptographic algorithms and protocols, such as SSH-2, which further enhance its security by providing robust encryption and authentication mechanisms. The protocol also supports forward secrecy, meaning that even if long-term keys or passwords are compromised, past communications remain secure. Furthermore, OpenSSH supports multiple authentication methods and can handle multiple sessions over a single connection, adding another layer of security by reducing the attack surface. (Answer) A key reason OpenSSH is considered secure is the fact that it encrypts all information, including usernames and passwords. This ensures that even if the data is intercepted, it remains unreadable without the proper decryption key. Additionally, OpenSSH supports various cryptographic algorithms and protocols, such as SSH-2, which further enhance its security by providing robust encryption and authentication mechanisms. The protocol also supports forward secrecy, meaning that even if long-term keys or passwords are compromised, past communications remain secure. Furthermore, OpenSSH supports multiple authentication methods and can handle multiple sessions over a single connection, adding another layer of security by\n\n--- Prompt Style 6 (Step-by-Step / Chain of Thought Cue) ---\n  Generated Answer:\n    OpenSSH is considered secure due to several key factors:\n\n1. **Encryption**: OpenSSH encrypts all information, including usernames and passwords, using the SSH-2 protocol. This ensures that data transmitted between the client and server is protected from unauthorized access.\n\n2. **Authentication**: SSH uses public key authentication, where the private key is kept secret. Only the owner of the key can authenticate, making it highly secure. This prevents unauthorized users from gaining access to the system.\n\n3. **Port Forwarding**: OpenSSH allows for the creation of secure tunnels over an unsecured network. For example, an SSH tunnel can be used to forward traffic from one port to another, making it harder for attackers to intercept data.\n\n4. **Multiplexing**: SSH-2 protocol supports multiplexing multiple TCP connections over a single SSH connection. This means that additional applications can be run within the SSH session, providing a secure and flexible environment.\n\n5. **Forward Secrecy**: Many OpenSSH implementations support forward secrecy, meaning that even if long-term secret keys or passwords are compromised, the encrypted communications and sessions recorded in the past cannot be retrieved and decrypted.\n\n6. **Customizable Authentication**: SSH supports a wide range of authentication methods, including custom authentication methods, making it highly configurable and secure.\n\n7. **Caveats and Improvements**: While OpenSSH is secure, it is always important to keep the software up-to-date and to verify the authenticity of the keys and certificates used for authentication\n\n--- Prompt Style 7 (Multi-Step Conditional Logic Attempt) ---\n  Generated Answer:\n    OpenSSH is considered secure due to several key reasons:\n\n1. **Encryption and Authentication**: OpenSSH encrypts all information, including usernames and passwords, ensuring that data transmitted between the client and server is protected from unauthorized access.\n\n2. **Multiplexing Connections**: OpenSSH allows the creation of multiple sessions over a single SSH connection, reducing overhead and increasing efficiency. This feature is similar to BEEP and is not available in other protocols like TLS.\n\n3. **Authentication Mechanisms**: OpenSSH uses a combination of public key authentication and other authentication methods, making it robust against various types of attacks. The server can identify the protocol version it supports, and some implementations even support both SSH-1 and SSH-2, providing backward compatibility.\n\n4. **Forward Secrecy**: If forward secrecy is enabled, encrypted communications and sessions recorded in the past cannot be retrieved and decrypted if long-term secret keys or passwords are compromised. This feature helps ensure that past sessions remain secure even if new vulnerabilities are discovered.\n\n5. **Security Through Obfuscation**: OpenSSH is designed with an open architecture, meaning its components can be modified and extended. This allows for the inclusion of new security features and improvements over time.\n\n6. **Anti-Tampering Measures**: OpenSSH includes various anti-tampering measures, such as the ability to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, making it less vulnerable to external threats.\n\nThese features combined make OpenSSH a highly secure and reliable protocol for secure communication over networks. \n\n(Note: The answer provided is based on the information in the context, which is correct and comprehensive.) \n###Answer\nOpenSSH is considered secure due to several key reasons:\n\n1. **Encryption and Authentication**: OpenSSH encrypts all information,\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":31},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Cell X: Programmatic Multi-Step RAG Logic\n\n# --- Choose a query for this test ---\nquery_index_for_programmatic = 0 # Example: Use the first sample query\nselected_query = sample_queries[query_index_for_programmatic]\nprint(f\"--- Programmatic Multi-Step RAG for Query: \\\"{selected_query}\\\" ---\")\n\n# --- Stage 0: Retrieve Context ---\nprint(\"\\n--- Stage 0: Retrieving Context ---\")\ntry:\n    # Use Mehdi's retriever function\n    retrieved_context_str = get_related_docs(selected_query, k=3) # Adjust k as per retriever's design\n    print(f\"Retrieved Context (first 300 chars):\\n'{retrieved_context_str[:300]}...'\")\nexcept Exception as e_retriever:\n    print(f\"  Error during context retrieval: {e_retriever}\")\n    retrieved_context_str = \"Error: Could not retrieve context.\"\n\n# --- Stage 1: Attempt to Answer Strictly from Context ---\nprint(\"\\n--- Stage 1: Attempting Answer Strictly from Context ---\")\n# Use a prompt that strongly encourages context-only answers and a specific \"not found\" phrase\nstrict_context_prompt = f\"Based ONLY on the following 'Provided Context', answer the 'Question'.
